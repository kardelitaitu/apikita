//! Claims these documents make about the CODE, checked rather than trusted.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. `docs/launch-checklist.md` gates a launch, and four of its nine
//! source citations had drifted to unrelated lines: one pointed at a bare `}`, one at
//! a comment about an error body, one at a struct field, one at a function parameter.
//! Every one still READ as a plausible citation - that is the failure mode - so nothing
//! flagged them, and a reader following one lands somewhere else without necessarily
//! noticing.
//!
//! THE REPOSITORY ALREADY KNOWS THE RULE. `tools/alert-check` fails if `alerts.tsv`
//! cites `observability.md:N`, because "a line citation re-points at its neighbour the
//! moment a row is added". That is the same rule. This is the generalisation: the
//! documents an operator acts on must cite code BY NAME.
//!
//! SCOPE, and it is deliberate. `docs/plans/` is EXCLUDED, because those are
//! HISTORICAL records: a plan that says `config.rs:89` was accurate when it was
//! written, and rewriting it would destroy the record of what was believed then. The
//! launch checklist is the opposite - it describes the present and is read as the
//! present - so a stale citation in it is a live defect.
//!
//! A TEST rather than a CI script, because it needs no new tool, no workflow step and
//! no entry in `tools/README.md`. It runs in the suite that already gates every
//! change, which is where a check earns its keep rather than where it is tidy.
//!
//! NO REGULAR EXPRESSION, deliberately. `regex` is not a dependency of this crate and
//! adding one to enforce a punctuation rule would be a poor trade. The pattern below
//! is "a known file extension, a colon, and a digit", which is three lines of
//! scanning.

/// The file extensions these documents cite. A bare word followed by a colon and a
/// digit is prose ("Gate 5:", "Section 3:") and is deliberately not matched.
